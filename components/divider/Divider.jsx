                I was 8 and my biggest problem at that time was that my favorite Tv cartoon channel was closing at 8pm.
                Finally now i have something to do after that time, playing with pc ــــــــــ
                and since then My relationship with Pc established and continues till now and i guess forever.
                I was Kind of the Nerd Guy among my friends. 
                I was the guy to go to when you need to download an online game or your favorite show or setup your new windows.
                years passed and my nerdy genes are growing more and more till when I was 13 I started to record my favorite games and uplaod it to youtube.
                14 I started to make YT tutorial videos about tech and programems.To learning JAVA and visual Basic when i was 15. and from 18 to 20 
                I started working as a freelance graphic designer and made it to be a level 2 seller on fiverr and TopRated on upwork.
                Then I started to learn Wordpress and make websites to people. till 2021 when I decided to be a front-end Developer when I truely know that is my passion.
